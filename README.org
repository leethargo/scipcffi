Please note that work on this project is discontinued in favor of the
[[http://cython.org][Cython]] based interface that is shipped with the [[http://scip.zib.de][SCIP sources]].

* Python wrapper for SCIP using cffi
built up step by step following [[http://cffi.readthedocs.org]].
** goals
   - easy to use interface to the SCIP solver
   - convenient and (pre-compiled) cross-platform packaging
   - prototyping of algorithms via SCIP plugins implemented in Python
   - make available SCIP features beyond MIP
     - global optimality of NLP, MINLP
     - (general) constraint programming
** maybe goals
   - interactive work (there is already the SCIP shell itself)
** non-goals
   - provide advanced modelling features
     - there's already packages like [[http://www.pyomo.org][Pyomo]], [[http://www.coin-or.org/PuLP/][PuLP]] or [[http://picos.zib.de/][PICOS]]
     - they can later interface this code
* dependencies
